<ul>

<li>How to keep your lever perches from breaking.</li>
<li>How to pull the tire up against chain tightening bolts when tighting the chain.</li>
<li>How to keep from getting pinch flats.</li>
<li>How to secure your bike in the back of your truck and have no pressure on your forks.</li>
<li>And last but not least, how to pivot turn over a log.</li>

</ul>

<ol>
<li>How to keep your lever perches from breaking.</li>
<ul>
<li>Unscrew the perch mounting bolts.</li>
<li>Wrap 1-2 wraps of tephlon tape where the perch was and replace the perch.</li>
<li>This will let the perch spin when you take a digger but will keep you from snapping your levers and perches.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>How to pull the tire up against chain tightening bolts when tighting the chain.</li>
<ul>
<li>Fold up a shop towel and or a rag and roll it up in between the sprocket and chain.</li>
<li>This will cause the tire axel to pull tightly up against the chain tighters, allowing you to tighten and loosen your chain with ease.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>How to keep from getting pinch flats.</li>
<ul>
<li>First off, when you are changing your tube, take a container of baby powder squirt a liberal amount of baby powder in the tire and spin the tire to coat the inside of the tire.</li>
<li>This will keep you from getting pinch flats.</li>
<li>Another option you can use is coating the tube in bearing grease.</li>
<li>Whatever you do. DO NOT USE BOTH!</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>How to secure your bike in the back of your truck and have no pressure on your forks.</li>
<ul>
<li>First pin the bike in the back of the truck with the front tire in one of the front corners of the truck bed and the back tire pushed up against the side of the bed. </li>
<li>This will secure the bike in the back of your truck with absolutely zero pressure on the forks.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>And last but not least, how to pivot turn over a log.</li>
<ul>
<li>Slowly roll up to the log at a sharp angle to the log.</li>
<li>Pop a wheelie.</li>
<li>As you pop the front tire off the ground pull the front tire towards and over the tree.</li>
<li>Your rear tire will spin up to the side of the tree and bounce over the tree leaving you on the other side of the tree.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
